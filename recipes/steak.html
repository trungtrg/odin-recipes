        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> Flat iron steak is cut from beef shoulder. To make a flat iron steak, butchers remove the connective tissue to separate the top shoulder blade into two cuts: One is the top blade, the other is the flat iron.
        </p>

        <p>Flat iron steak is nicely marbled and is less expensive than other steaks, which makes it a popular choice among home cooks. When it's cooked correctly, flat iron steak is wonderfully tender and juicy. 
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredient</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (2 pound) flat iron steak</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Direction</h3>
        <ol>
